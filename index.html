            'The Receding Hairline Buzz': 'Dealing with a receding hairline or trying to work with a very prominent widow\'s peak? A short buzz cut will make those bald areas look purposeful, instead of like something you hate!',
            'Temp Fade Buzz': 'Nothing makes a man look more classy and fresh than a buzz cut with a temp fade. If you have a round face, a buzz cut that includes a temp fade will give your face a sharp definition, which is sexy!',
            'Medium Buzz': 'Not ready to go super short but still want something easy to maintain? A buzz cut with medium length is semi-short, but leaves enough hair that you can work in some product to create a more finished look.',
            'Buzz Cut with High Fade': 'Many buzz cuts are just one short length all around the head. Switch it up a bit by throwing in a medium or high fade. The style above is great for round faces since there\'s a curved shape at the forehead, yet the fade makes the head appear slender.',
            'Thin Hair Buzz': 'If your hair is on the thinner side, you can still pull off a trendy buzz cut. To not draw attention to the thinness, stick to the short buzz cuts and rock with confidence!',
            'The Military or Induction Buzz Cut': 'The induction or military cut can be considered the most extreme style for a buzz haircut. Basically, it is the famous military buzz cut which leaves you with a little hair left on your scalp. This cut was specifically meant for army troops to promote unity. However, this hairstyles comes with the minimal style.',
            'Burr Buzz Cut': 'Burr cut is basically an induction cut with just longer hair to satisfy the military look. If you\'re not sure that you are capable of pulling off the induction cut, then this is the ultimate solution. If you have a rectangular face shape, then you can readily pull off this look. The hairstyle requires a great deal of maintenance to keep the length in check.',
            'Crew Buzz Cut': 'If you want to go for a shorter length of hair on the side leading up to long hair on the top, the crew cut is the best choice. The hairstyle is preferred by sportsmen to ensure that the hair doesn\'t become a hindrance. The overall style of the cut may depend on the shape of your skull and face.',
            'Flat Top Buzz Cut': 'The flat top buzz cut hairstyle can be very similar to the crew cut. Here, the flat top of the buzz hair leads to long hair on the top. The whole style can result in a sharper look to flaunt. This hairstyle can also be termed as a long buzz cut as compared to other styles.',
            'Faded Buzz Cut': 'This fade haircut stands out from most of the common buzz cut hairstyles. It requires a skin type of fade cut on the side with short trimmed hair on the top. This stylish and trendy haircut can be a great choice of hairstyle to flaunt.',
            'Brush Buzz Cut': 'The brush cut can be referred to as the longest of all the buzz haircuts. The hair length is almost the same all around the head. It\'s the longest hair choice you can go for with a buzz cut. Men with an oval face shape can pull this look off easily with their flexible flexible features.',
